# üöÄIBM PBEL Program (Generative AI)

This repository contains a collection of mini-projects and practical notebooks developed as part of the **IBM Project-Based Experiential Learning (PBEL)** program in the domain of **Generative AI**.

Each task focuses on a specific concept, ranging from foundational Natural Language Processing (NLP) to advanced deep learning and image generation using state-of-the-art APIs. The goal of these projects was to gain hands-on experience with real-world AI tools and frameworks through guided, applied learning.
